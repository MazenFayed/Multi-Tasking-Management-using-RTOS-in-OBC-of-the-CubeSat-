The Cube Satellite (CubeSat) is an ideal solution to gain access to space in terms of budget and integration time for research and experimental science payloads. The On-Board Computer (OBC) is considered to be the main subsystem of the CubeSat among others. It manages all the tasks taking place within the satellite using RTOS. Its main function is to interpret the orders from Earth As Telemetry, treat and return the results. This book surveys a previously developed CubeSat OBCs with focus on the characteristics of the embedded system used in the design and implementation phases. Then, it presents the design, development and implementation process of a prototype OBC hardware and software and Multi-Tasking Mangement using RTOS in OBC of the CubeSat.
The proposed software architecture is implemented as a prototype on one of STMicroelectronics boards. The choice of this development board was highly motivated by the mission of the CubeSat. Finally, a series of tests are successfully conducted to evaluate the proposed architecture.
